This project involves creating a program for a strategy game on an MxN grid. The player's goal is to navigate the grid, collecting food for energy while avoiding ghosts. Each turn, the player moves to an adjacent square, with ghosts possibly moving too. The game ends when all squares are visited, a ghost is encountered, or energy runs out.
